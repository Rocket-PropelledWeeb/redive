# Custom Charts

There's a chart editor called [BAKKA](https://github.com/Goatgarien/BAKKA-Editor/). 
Join their discord for more information.

There also exists a browser-based chart visualizer called [MercuryPlayer](https://yellowberryhn.github.io/MercuryPlayer/), which can be used to view charts without opening them up in an editor. A nice way to preview charts made by others. The version linked specifically has support for previewing charts on a cab, if you so desire for whatever reason.

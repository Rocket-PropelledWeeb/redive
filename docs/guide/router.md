# Network Guide

For connecting to a private server you'll want one of the following:

- GL.iNet GL-AR750 (Creta)
- GL.iNet GL-AR750S (Slate)
- GL.iNet GL-MT300N-V2 (Mango)

or any router that supports OpenWrt 22.03

If you need Wi-Fi, Slate is the recommended one to go with, however you *can* make Mango's perform adequately with 
Wi-Fi on dedicated access points.

The routers are powered via USB, so you can plug it into the ALLS. However, ALLS USB ports aren't always live, so 
you should plug it into the router port if you run into any network issues.
Something to note, having the Creta reboot every so often helps them stay connected, 
probably because NAT connection state loss on upstream routers.

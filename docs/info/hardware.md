# Hardware

The hardware that makes up the WACCA cab is an interesting amalgamation
of completely custom parts and off-the-shelf components. Here's some information about it.

## ALLS HX

The ALLS HX is a specialty PC designed by SEGA for use in arcade games.
It is the brain of the cab, actually running the game.

![Power supplies](https://github.com/jbamuro/waccamole/raw/main/img/DSC00812.JPG)

These two units supply all the power needed for the PCB components (sound system, LEDs, touch controller etc).
My photos will look a little different at the bottom as we had to jerry rig an extension cable to feed power into the unit since I don't have the original cabling for it. Works fine on American power, there are also reports of it working fine in Europe.

R1 uses a 300VA but that's probably overkill.

Hits about 200W during attract mode.
TODO: power info during songlist pull etc.

## Touch Boards

There are two of these and they each process 6 segments. Together they control the two halves of the touch controller assembly (for a total of 12 segments).

![Master Touch Unit Control Board](https://github.com/jbamuro/waccamole/raw/main/img/DSC00814.JPG "Master Touch Unit Control Board for the 6 segments on the right of the touch assembly (Can be determined thanks to it's ID, currently set to 8. The controller ID for the left segments is 7)")

Each segment of the touch controller is connected to the others with the help of RS485 through a ribbon cable.
The PCBs present on each segment are the exact same with the addition of a custom Pentel IC and some extra components needed to drive the tactile sensor array.

## LED Control Board

It sends the pretty colors to the touch controller.

![LED Data board](https://github.com/jbamuro/waccamole/raw/main/img/DSC00813.JPG "An LED Data board, connected to the ALLS using usb")

Here's a rundown of what this board is made out of:

## I/O Control Board (837-15257-01)

![I/O Control Board](https://github.com/jbamuro/waccamole/raw/main/img/DSC00817.JPG)
 The existence of this board is a bit overkill for what it's used for, likely it *had* to be used due to SEGA producing the cabinets for Marvelous. This is a newer version of the control board that has a USB port on it, almost all sega cabs use this now.

 *Note: WACCA does NOT check for a coin counter, so the resistor trick is not needed to apply credits in game.*
 
## Control Panel

This giant metal LED lined panel has [4] plugs that connect to

1. Card reader
2. VFD display to show IC readout for cash cards. Mine had some burn in. *Unused.*
3. Headphone amp jack with VOL UP and VOL DOWN buttons
4. All the LEDs

The coin entry stuff connected to the cash box is here too.

### Card Reader
The Aime card reader is model number **610-0955**. There are lots of good solutions to DIY one of these.

## Touch Panels

The touch controller assembly is composed of 12 segments divided into two halves 
(6 per side, each having their own main controller board). They each have an individual channel ranging from 1 to 6.

![WACCA touch segment](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/568491469799817246/1143565017216733204/PXL_20230822_151822250.jpg "Three segments on my small table")

Each one of these weighs 1kg (2.2LBS) *(870g if the metal bracket is removed)* which totals to about 12kg (26LBS).


Each unit has 5 LED strips (each strip has 8 LEDs making for a total of 40 LEDs per segment). 
In total, there are 480 LEDs in the touch controller assembly

The sensor array is made out of 5 columns and 4 rows amounting to 20 touch zones par segment. 
All 12 segments amount to a total of 240 touch zones.

Somehow I never really understood how MASSIVE these units are until I held an individual segment in my hand.

Here are some scans of a segment that shows the curve profile.
